With this code you will be able to run successfully all oh the Challenge's_5 excercises, the only problem that I have was with this excercise: "Calculate Quartiles, Find Outliers, and Create a Box Plot", I asked for help in Slack but the person that helped me gave me the code for all that part of the exercise. I analyzed his/her code and I understood it but still left it inside my code.

ThatÂ´s why that part of the code looks different from the rest.
